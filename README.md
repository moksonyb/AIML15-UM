# AI and Machine Learning: Controlling Agents in Unity

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Bachelor of Computer Science curriculum at Maastricht University (2024-2025). The main objective of this project is to evaluate and analyze the performance of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for controlling agents in real-time video game environments built with the Unity Game Engine. 

The project is divided into three phases:
1. Setting up the necessary tools and making initial modifications to the ML-Agents code.
2. Running training algorithms and implementing custom sensor inputs for agents.
3. Profiling and analyzing the performance of the agents and algorithms.

## ML-Agents Toolkit

This project uses the [Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), an open-source project that enables games and simulations created using the Unity platform to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. For this project, we use a specific [forked version of ML-Agents](https://github.com/DennisSoemers/ml-agents/tree/fix-numpy-release-21-branch), which includes necessary fixes for smooth integration with our environment.

## Setup and Dependencies

To get started, please follow the installation steps for Unity, ML-Agents, and the necessary Python environment, as documented in the project’s [setup guide](https://github.com/DennisSoemers/ml-agents/tree/fix-numpy-release-21-branch).

Ensure you have the following:
- Unity Game Engine
- Git for version control
- Python with the required virtual environments and dependencies

You can find further details on dependencies and installation tips in the project documentation.
