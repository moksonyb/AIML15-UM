# My Project Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Champions of the C.U.B.E.

## Overview

This project is part of the Bachelor of Computer Science curriculum at Maastricht University (2024-2025). The main objective of this project is to evaluate and analyze the performance of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for controlling agents in real-time video game environments built with the Unity Game Engine.. For more information, visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/moksonyb/AIML15-UM.git).

The project is divided into three phases:

    1. Setting up the necessary tools and making initial modifications to the ML-Agents code.
    2. Running training algorithms and implementing custom sensor inputs for agents.
    3. Profiling and analyzing the performance of the agents and algorithms.
