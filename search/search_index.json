The main objective of this project is to evaluate and analyze the performance of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for controlling agents in real-time video game environments built with the Unity Game Engine.. For more information, visit our GitHub repository.</p> <p>The project is divided into three phases:</p> <pre><code>1. Setting up the necessary tools and making initial modifications to the ML-Agents code.\n2. Running training algorithms and implementing custom sensor inputs for agents.\n3. Profiling and analyzing the performance of the agents and algorithms.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>To get started with the project, follow the installation and usage instructions...</p>"}]}
