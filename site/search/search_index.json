Overview This project is part of the Bachelor of Computer Science curriculum at Maastricht University (2024-2025). The main objective of this project is to evaluate and analyze the performance of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for controlling agents in real-time video game environments built with the Unity Game Engine.. For more information, visit our GitHub repository . The project is divided into three phases: 1. Setting up the necessary tools and making initial modifications to the ML-Agents code. 2. Running training algorithms and implementing custom sensor inputs for agents. 3. Profiling and analyzing the performance of the agents and algorithms.
